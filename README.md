## Installation

1. Clone the repo and `cd` into it

1. Rename or copy `.env.example` file to `.env`
1. `php artisan key:generate`
1. Set your database credentials in your `.env` file
1. Set your Stripe credentials in your `.env` file. Specifically `STRIPE_KEY` and `STRIPE_SECRET`
1. Set your Algolia credentials in your `.env` file. Specifically `ALGOLIA_APP_ID` and `ALGOLIA_SECRET`.
1. Set your Braintree credentials in your `.env` file if you want to use PayPal. Specifically `BT_MERCHANT_ID`, `BT_PUBLIC_KEY`, `BT_PRIVATE_KEY`. If you don't, it should still work but won't show the paypal payment at checkout.
1. Set your `APP_URL` in your `.env` file. This is needed for Voyager to correctly resolve asset URLs.
1. Set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in your `.env` file if you want to specify an admin password. If not, the default password is 'password'

1. `php artisan serve` or use Laravel Valet or Laravel Homestead
1. Visit `localhost:8000` in your browser

## Shopping Cart Package

I originally used the [Crinsane/LaravelShoppingcart](https://github.com/Crinsane/LaravelShoppingcart) package but it is slow to update to the latest versions of Laravel.
## Windows Users - money_format() issue

The `money_format` function does not work in Windows. Take a look at [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6369887/alternative-to-money-format-function-in-php-on-windows-platform/18990145). As an alternative, just use the `number_format` function instead.

1. In `app/helpers.php` replace `money_format` line with `return '$'.number_format($price / 100, 2);`
1. In `app/Product.php` replace `money_format` line with `return '$'.number_format($this->price / 100, 2);`
1. In `config/cart.php` set the `thousand_seperator` to an empty string or you might get a 'non well formed numeric value encountered' error. It conflicts with `number_format`.
